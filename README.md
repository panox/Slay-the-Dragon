### what was a win

* After a lot of trial and error making the whole thing work
* Going back on previous commits after new features did not work 

### what you've been struggling with

* Sprite Animation and combining it with position left animation
* Making sure the attack animations do not fire after the game has finished
* Correctly resetting everything once the game is over

### what would you have done differently if you had to do it again 

* Make the healing method part of my prototype so that it can be called on my enemy object if needed later on.
* Collect all my sounds beforehand.
* Do research on which plugins I will use for the project.
* Positioned the names and buttons in a different way 

### what you've learnt during the project

* How to use javascript libraries and reading their documentation
* Using animations and sprite animations
